# Computer-Organisation-

This is the project done by Group No. A25. As of now, it includes a fully functional assembler, written in Python, that takes as input the file 'stdin.txt' which contains the
assembly instructions. The output is a binary file which contains either the binary form of the instructions if the instructions are all valid, or ONLY ONE error message if any of
the lines has an error in it.

All our code is in 1 file, by the name of 'Assembler.py'. The code uses functions primarily along with  if-else blocks as well as some input-output file tricks to counter some of 
the errors that we could encounter.



Some Notes for the TAs:-

1) The code returns special error messages for a couple of errors that we thought might be there in the test cases apart from those given in the project document file. Any other error is called a 'General Syntax Error.'

2) We assumed that we had to print ony one error and not all the errors that are possible as it was explicitly mentioned to do so in the project documents.
